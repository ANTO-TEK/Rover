P.U.O.R.C. (Perceptive Ultrasound Operative Rover Companion): a real-time and safety-critical Rover

Delighted to present our university project, a groundbreaking ROVER designed for real-time and safety-critical applications! üåê‚öôÔ∏è

## üîç High-Level Functional Specifications:

1. Receives external commands from the PS2 controller.
2. Adaptable in analog and digital command modes.
3. Joystick inputs for nuanced control, ensuring real-time responsiveness.
4. Right-side buttons for customizable emergency stops, vehicle halt, LED activation, or other critical commands.
5. Moves with user-defined speed, synchronized across all four motors, prioritizing safety.
6. Rotates around its center of gravity, ensuring precise maneuvers with synchronized motor control.
7. Reads data from predefined sensors, interfacing with established safety protocols.
8. Utilizes ultrasound sensors for safety-critical obstacle detection up to 3 meters away, front, and 45¬∞ left/right.
9. Implements a "Motor Halt" state promptly on obstacle identification in the forward path.
10. Incorporates smooth braking dynamics for enhanced safety.
11. Emergency braking on sudden obstacles within 70 cm, rotating towards available free side for optimal safety.
12. Ensures no forward movement if an obstacle is detected while stationary.
13. 180¬∞ rotation before reversing, unlockable with a customizable combo.
14. Halts on immediate identification of component malfunction for utmost safety.
15. Degrades to a limited-speed mode on specific safety-critical malfunctions.
